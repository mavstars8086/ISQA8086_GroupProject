#Descriptive Statistics

In order to summarise our data set , we can use functions like summary,str,mean,max,range,sd in R. And compute the various statistical computations on the variables. 
Based on the data set we have retrieved with permission from Linda Loring Nature Foundation , we can use the mean of the phenophase status to figure out which species had more phenophase activity over a range of 4years from 2015-2018. 
Since most of the variables in our data set are categorical variables , we are limited to the variable phenophase status on which can perform descriptive statistics.
Going forward once we have the temperature data set cleaned and merged with the species data we hope we can perform more statistical computations.
